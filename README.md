Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

# Newsletter Sign-up Form

A responsive and two-state newsletter sign-up form with client-side validation.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Newsletter sign-up form" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The main objective was to create a functional form that validates user input and seamlessly transitions to a success message upon submission. This project demonstrates the use of **JavaScript** for handling client-side form validation and managing the user interface to switch between two different states: the initial sign-up form and the final success message.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the form, its input fields, and the success message.
* **CSS3:** For all the styling, including the responsive layout that changes from a two-column desktop view to a single-column mobile view. CSS also handles the styling of the error states.
* **JavaScript:** The core technology that brings the form to life. It handles:
    * The email validation logic (checking for valid format and empty fields).
    * Displaying and hiding error messages based on user input.
    * Toggling the visibility of the form and the success message.

## Installation

This is a static frontend project, so no complex setup is required. To get a local copy, simply follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/hangtime319/newsletter-sign-up.git](https://github.com/hangtime319/newsletter-sign-up.git)
    ```
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the project.

## Usage

This project serves as a showcase of a practical, two-state UI component. The user can:
* Enter an email address and click "Subscribe".
* See an error message if the email is invalid or empty.
* See a successful confirmation message after providing a valid email.

## Features

* **Two-State UI:** The component smoothly transitions from the sign-up form to a confirmation screen.
* **Client-side Validation:** The form validates the email input in real-time before submission.
* **Dynamic Error Messages:** Clear error messages are displayed when the user provides invalid input.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout is optimized to look great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
